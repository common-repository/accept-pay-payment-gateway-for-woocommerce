Accept Pay Gateway for accepting payments on your WooCommerce Store.

== Description ==

Accept Pay integration is the easiest way to start processing online payments. It can take as little as 20 minutes to set up and is by far the quickest way to integrate Opayo.

Form integration is designed to pass transaction details from your website to Opayo to carry out authorisation and processing of payments. Outsourcing your payment processing in this way means that no sensitive data is collected, stored or transferred from your site.

This Plugin allows you to accept Opayo Payments removing the need for you to maintain highly secure encrypted databases, obtain digital certificates and invest in high-level PCI DSS compliance.

2. If you use the WordPress plugin uploader to install this plugin skip to step 4.
